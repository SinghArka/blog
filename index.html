				<h2>Who I am as an IB Learner</h2>
				<p>Someone rightly said, “Creativity can solve almost any problem. The creative act, the defeat of habit by originality, overcomes everything.”</p>
				<p>My name is Arka, and in this blog I will be talking about key things that make me unique and how they will help contribute to my learning community and make me an ideal IB student.</p>
				<p>I have been a student of the French Immersion Program since Grade 1. Recently, I have been enrolled in the ISELP program which has opened up avenues for my learning and development. I have always been keen about the IB program and its elite learning environment. I would be absolutely thrilled to get enrolled in this program.</p>
				<p>I have always been very curious in school and at home. This makes my brain muscles stronger and keeps it active; this gives me satisfaction. Having a curious mind helps me to have a fresh perspective and can open up new opportunities in learning. I make sure to ask some questions every single day in class. As Einstein said, "Curiosity is more important than intelligence". Once in Grade 5, I heard about an innovative technology in gardening called a hydroponics tower. I asked my parents about what it was, and also did some research on making a DIY hydroponics tower. We are planning to make one soon.</p>
				<p>I believe that communication is the key in any given situation. I express my ideas to the group/class with full confidence. I patiently listen to ideas of group members, as well as share my own ideas. Mark Twain once said, An open mind leaves a chance for someone to drop a worthwhile thought in it.  I think that communication is a lot like a highlighter; one needs to use it in order to clarify information to others. Without communication, it would be amazingly difficult to develop strong relationships. One time in Grade 4, we had a group project in which we had to create a scaffold made out of straws which could withstand a load of one pound. I was the leader of the group, and I kept the team on the right track through prompt communication. That day, it was reinforced to me that communication is the key to collaboration and achieving success.</p>
				<p>I am always determined to complete my given tasks and don’t give up easily. I attempt every possible alternative to complete a task. I face challenges with perseverance and determination. Recently, in Grade 5, the class was given a challenging logical mathematics task, and we all found it very hard. Most students gave up easily, but I was determined to solve the problem using alternative approaches and I succeeded!</p>
				<p>Principled learners are honest and have dignity for others. I try to encourage all students to play and work in teams. I respect everyone’s cultures and traditions. I don’t discriminate against other people due to their race. Recently, in Grade 5, some boys from my class were playing basketball. In my class, there was also a girl named Alicia and she was excellent at basketball. The boys were unaware of Alicia's skill and wouldn't let Alicia practice basketball with them. One day, I convinced the other boys to play basketball with Alicia. And guess what? Alicia was playing so well that she went for the intramurals and got selected for the school basketball team!</p>
				<p>I use creative, critical, and out-of-the-box thinking to solve complex problems. Critical thinking helps me to analyze facts and form a judgment. It also helps me to come up with innovative, creative ideas and supports me in making better decisions everywhere. Critical thinking enables me to better reflect on myself. Recently, in Grade 5, we had a group assignment in STAC class about building a 30 cm bridge with popsicle sticks, which could hold a minimum of 2 pounds. I used my critical thinking skills to conclude on facts about truss bridges. Then, I finally decided to build a Pratt Truss bridge. I communicated with our group and tried out the idea. As Henry David Thoreau said, "If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity.”</p>
				<p>I make conceptual understanding in myself when researching or being taught on any subject - this increases my knowledge. An ancient text says, “Knowledge is the true organ of sight, not the eyes.” It is important to be knowledgeable because the more one knows, the easier it will be for them to learn new things. In class, I attentively listen to the teacher's lectures, as well as ask many questions. This builds my knowledge. Sometimes, I go find out the answers myself. I read books, encyclopedias, and articles. I also listen to technology podcasts.</p>
				<p>I have empathy for others. Caring makes me and the other person feel happy too. I feel happy because I helped someone make their day better. When caring for someone, I have a feeling of accomplishment; and it makes me happy. Caring helps build stronger relationships with other people.</p>
				<p>We learn when we make mistakes. This thought makes me open to taking up challenges and risks. One time in Grade 5, we were assigned a group project in which we had to create a slide deck on a natural disaster that wrecked havoc in North America. Our group chose the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, and I took the risk of being the leader of the group. The risk was that if our group makes a mistake, I would be accountable for that. I positively took the opportunity of leading the group regardless of my lack of knowledge on the subject. I did research, assigned work, and systematically approached the subject. The team was commended for including details from in-depth research.</p>
				<p>Being open minded in a team environment helps me learn new things. It would become difficult to keep learning things in the same technique. Reaching out to others helps me look at things from different perspectives. It enables me to address unique problems differently.</p>
				<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe and sincerely hope that I qualify for the IB MYP program requirements. I am confident that this amazing opportunity will enhance my knowledge and learning skills. I appreciate your consideration for this program.</p>
